# IntelliTutor: Cultivating Minds Through Quizzes
CAB302 Assignment 1 - Semester 1, 2025

**Project Overview:**

Quiz Coach is an innovative AI-powered learning platform designed to revolutionize the way students engage with study materials. By leveraging artificial intelligence, our application enables students to generate quizzes of varying difficulty levels based on their chosen subjects, receive instant feedback, and track their progress over time.

Our goal is to enhance learning efficiency and promote active engagement with study materials by making AI an integral part of the classroom experience. As a development team, we have identified a significant underutilization of artificial intelligence in education and aim to bridge this gap. Through this application, we strive to provide students with a dynamic, personalized, and accessible learning tool that adapts to their individual needs and learning pace.

**Features:**

- **Personalized Quiz Generation** – Students can create quizzes based on their study materials and customize the difficulty level to challenge themselves appropriately.

- **Instant Feedback** – The AI provides immediate explanations for incorrect answers, enabling students to understand their mistakes and improve their knowledge.

- **Study Material Upload** – Students can upload study notes or documents, allowing the AI to generate quizzes based on their content.

- **Secure User Authentication** – Users can sign up, log in, and securely store their progress data, ensuring privacy and trust.

- **Progress Tracking & Visualization** – A graphical representation of quiz performance over time helps students monitor their improvement.

With its emphasis on accessibility and ease of use, the platform caters to a diverse range of users, ensuring a seamless and engaging learning experience.
